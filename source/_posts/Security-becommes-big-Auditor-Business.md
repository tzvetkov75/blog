IT Security Audits are mandatory from 2018 in Germany and majority of EU for critical infrastructures and digital providers. IT Security is essential for our normal life and therefore, it needs to be threated in the same way as construction safety, financial institutions stability, water supply etc.

## EU Regulatory

The main EU Regulation is the directive on security of network and information systems, know as [NIS Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive). 

The service or infrastructure provider private or public are classified in two groups.

__Operators of essential services__ (ES) are consider as:
 + Energy: electricity, oil and gas
 + Transport: air, rail, water and road
 + Banking: credit institutions
 + Financial market infrastructures: trading venues, central counterparties
 + Health: healthcare settings
 + Water: drinking water supply and distribution

__Digital service providers__ (DSP) are: 
 + Online marketplaces (which allow businesses to set up shops on the marketplace in order to make their products and services available online)
 + Cloud computing services
 + Search engines
   
The directive does not define threshold of what is a significant incident requiring notification and delegates to the relevant national authority (More information in [EU Fact Sheet](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-2422_en.htm)). The commission suggests 3 parameters which should be taken into consideration:
- Number of users affected
- Duration of incident
- Geographic spread

### What the companies need to do?

Overview of some major points 

|Name|Essential Services Provider|Digital service providers|
|----|---------------------------|---------------------------|
|Take technical and organisational measures | Yes | Yes (partial) | 
|__Provide info on information systems, security policies etc__ | __Yes__ | __Yes__ |
| __Provide evidence (result security audits)__ | __Yes__ | __No__ |
|Execute binding instructions by the NCA | Yes | No |
| Remedy any failure to fulfil the NIS Directive | No | Yes |
| Designate a representative if needed | No | Yes |
| Notify on major incident without undue delay| Yes* | Yes* |
| Inform the public about individual incidents | No | Yes |
 Exceptions *


### Local legacy 

The EU countries will or have already adapted this directive.  __Germany__ provides similar directive [KRITIS](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Industrie_KRITIS/IT-SiG/it_sig_node.html).  __France__ has eqivalent low enforcement [ANSSI](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/cybersecurity-in-france/ciip-in-france/) and [CINL](https://www.cnil.fr/fr).

An overview of world wide enforcement can be gained with nice overview [Touring the World of Cybersecurity Law](https://www.rsaconference.com/writable/presentations/file_upload/law-w04-global_cybersecurity_laws_regulations_and_liability.pdf)

## What does it mean concrete?

1. The affected companies must complete __security programs__ and governance. Chief information security officer (CISO) will have enough to do.
2. External __security__ audit must be conducted every 2 years in most of the cases. The auditing companies, like KPNG, E&Y etc, have already build large security departments for auditing and for sure, have enough to do.
 - Audit security standard like,[ISO 27008](http://www.iso27001security.com/html/27008.html), is not specified. The reason is that there is big difference between the needs of small and big companies. Formal standard will be probably the next step in several years.  

Ethical Hacker or Pen Tester were yesterday. Today they are auditors, like finical ones. This means __gold rush__ for the companies that can provide this services.

It is not more playing kids games on hackers and sys admins - this is the big boys business.

This is good - we can not leave IT security to dark net hackers, mercy of investors or risk perception of company owers. It is social responsibility to achieve safety in it security on the essential services.
